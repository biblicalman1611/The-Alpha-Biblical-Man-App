# Enable Cloud Functions API - Quick Fix

The deployment is almost ready! You just need to enable one API in Google Cloud.

---

## Option 1: One-Click Enable (Easiest)

**Click this link:**
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/cloudfunctions.googleapis.com/overview?project=the-biblical-man

Then:
1. Click the blue **"ENABLE"** button
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for it to activate
3. Come back here - I'll deploy automatically

---

## Option 2: Enable via Console

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library?project=the-biblical-man
2. Search for "Cloud Functions API"
3. Click on it
4. Click **"ENABLE"**
5. Wait 1-2 minutes

---

## After Enabling

Once you've clicked "Enable", just let me know and I'll complete the deployment!

The deployment will then take about 2-3 minutes to:
- Upload the webhook code
- Create the Cloud Function
- Give you the webhook URL
- Tell you what to add to Stripe

---

## What You're Enabling

**Cloud Functions API** allows your project to run serverless functions. This is what will:
- Listen for Stripe webhooks
- Create Firebase accounts automatically
- Send welcome emails

It's free for the first 2 million invocations/month (you'll use maybe 100/month).

**Next Step:** Click the link above and enable the API, then let me know when it's done!
